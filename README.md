# Predict Income

Data: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult

The goal is to predict whether the income of the observations is higher than 50k or not. Hence, this is a classification problem. Some questions to bear in mind:

- How much correlation there is among the input variables? Depending on the type of models used, the extent of correlation may have different implications.
- Are there any further processing needed for the features, be it normalization, categorization of continuous variables etc.
- How balanced is the output label? And does it have some implications for the evaluation metrics?
- What approaches are used to avoid overfitting?
- If the models selecetd have hyperparameters, how are these hyperparameters tuned?
- What are typical metrics to evaluate the performance of the models, and how to interpret the outcome of these metrics?
- What explainability methods can be used to understand the model?
